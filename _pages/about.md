I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at Boston University. I am interested in Empirical Industrial Organization. My research focuses on the mergers in the Internet Service Provider (ISP) Market and analyzes the effects of the merger. Besides, I am also interested in the spatial distribution of data centers and evaluating potential inefficiencies in data center networks.
